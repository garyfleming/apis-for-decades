# Possible TODOs.


*  ufo 50. 5 devs. Fictional console with colour and sound limits. Other technical limits. 50 games. Constraints enabled going faster! 35 games made in a year or so.
* transactive memory - the idea that we store our ideas and knowledge outside ourselves. I don’t need to know how a remote works if my wife knows. I don’t need to know the emotional relationships between people if someone I know and trust does it for me. This is somewhat like generic controls. Don’t need to know how to navigate a set if the server can tell me
* Talk about the intentionality of design. Leads to templating.
* Talk about some of the issues with object mappers for view generation (coupling, less clarity, undesigned). Suggest templating as an alternative.
* Alice Juarrero's work on chage and evolutionary design -- Dynamics in Action
* Whole bunch of stuff I'm not touching (layered systems, true HATEOAS)
* Contract Tests (Currently way too quick.)
* Alternatives to REST: GraphQL
* Voice control related: chatbot. ELIZA, first "AI" chatbot. Like the quote in this article about delusional thinking: https://blog.myralabs.com/your-chatbot-needs-a-name-b8f92f337386
* "Time drags" - the past has a dragging effect on the present. From the book Time Binds, by the Queer Theorist, Elizabeth Freeman
* Actual HTML5 example -- worked through. Pains etc
* Richardson Maturity model. good for thinking about some aspects of REST but doesn’t go far enough.
* Anything of use in this response about REST not being SOAP and RPC being fine for RPCy stuff? https://philsturgeon.uk/api/2017/12/18/rest-confusion-explained/
* Add this jabe quote to the affordance caveat: https://twitter.com/cyetain/status/955506555105042432
* Jabe: designing away complexity https://twitter.com/cyetain/status/955504793321136129
* More on forms. Current version skips way too much. First that "form" as in web page device and "form" as in shape of a thing are intentionally similar. Talk more about the affordance provided by describing some form of the shape of the thing expected. Visualise it by showing an actual form.
* More on how to actually implement a client using domain knowledge rather than fixed links. What would that look like?
