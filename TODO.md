# Possible TODOs.


* New structure for longer version? Pair a design/philosophy section explicitly with an implementation change section. Lead up to the html5 bit at the end.

* Ship of Theseus - paradox by Plutarch -- Gladwell golf episode had names for two interpretations (22:15ish)
Mereological theory of identity - New ship. Thing is the sum of it's parts. Change the parts, change the thing.
Spatio-temporal continuity theory - Object can maintain its identity as long as the change is gradual and the form or the shape of the object is preserved through the change of its components materials.

*  ufo 50. 5 devs. Fictional console with colour and sound limits. Other technical limits. 50 games. Constraints enabled going faster! 35 games made in a year or so.
*  testing: fuzzers. Force use of affordances by randomising links in test envs. Force discovery of structure by adding randomised noise; Json that looks like the real thing but isn’t  (done this before)
* transactive memory - the idea that we store our ideas and knowledge outside ourselves. I don’t need to know how a remote works if my wife knows. I don’t need to know the emotional relationships between people if someone I know and trust does it for me. This is somewhat like generic controls. Don’t need to know how to navigate a set if the server can tell me
* Talk about the intentionality of design. Leads to templating.
* Talk about some of the issues with object mappers for view generation (coupling, less clarity, undesigned). Suggest templating as an alternative.
* Affordances: use mario games as an example. The "star" shape you know to use for pounding in different
contexts (tanks, stairs etc) is an example. Question Mark blocks are another.
* Alice Juarrero's work on chage and evolutionary design -- Dynamics in Action
* Tweet: "APIs are hard. They are pretty much ship now, regret later" - @Chethaase https://twitter.com/chiuki/status/927232305784950784
* Whole bunch of stuff I'm not touching (layered systems, true HATEOAS)
* Contract Tests (Currently way too quick.)
* Alternatives to REST: GraphQL
* Text Adventures as bad analogues for generic api controls
* Voice control. Limited sensible verbs. leads to RESTy design. At least helps flush out hateoas controls.
* Voice control related: chatbot. ELIZA, first "AI" chatbot. Like the quote in this article about delusional thinking: https://blog.myralabs.com/your-chatbot-needs-a-name-b8f92f337386
* "Time drags" - the past has a dragging effect on the present. From the book Time Binds, by the Queer Theorist, Elizabeth Freeman
* Cars have brakes so we can drive faster. APIs have tests (particularly contract tests) to allow us to change faster
* Japanese bullet trains exiting tunnels made a sonic boom like noise (air compression). They looked to nature for answers. Found the kingfisher -> Faster, more energy efficient, and much quieter. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMtXqTmfta0
* No idea the analogue of natural things for API design. Figure it out. Make a wild leap.
* Web pages as analogues of REST APIs. Discovering controls in real time. Often stateless. etc.
* Evolution does have an analogue in versioning. There was no v2 for animals, just constant evolutionary change.
* After the bit about Generic controls, expand into non-generic controls, standard resource manipulation mechanisms, and some stuff about how it's fine to expect agent domain knowledge for particular resources.
* Actual HTML5 example -- worked through. Pains etc
* Richardson Maturity model. good for thinking about some aspects of REST but doesn’t go far enough.
* Anything of use in this response about REST not being SOAP and RPC being fine for RPCy stuff? https://philsturgeon.uk/api/2017/12/18/rest-confusion-explained/

* Add this jabe quote to the affordance caveat: https://twitter.com/cyetain/status/955506555105042432
* Jabe: designing away complexity https://twitter.com/cyetain/status/955504793321136129
