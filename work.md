# Changes

* Frame the whole thing through what we need from an API that will list Decades. Consider telling a motiviating story about such a system
* Slide image pass: more images. Either full screen or some large chunk
* Stronger opening.
* Affordance section works. Insert Mario example before floppy disk.
* Add Jabe's tweets to the caveat
* Rest into hypermedia into hypertext doesn't work.
* Visualise the collections controls: example with stuff
* The "Generic" slide doesn't work
* Possibly more on non-collection controls
* "Lesson" or "Conclusion" on the "Make Afforded APIs" slide.
* Tell Japanese bullet train story before Evolution
* "Evolution" slide content is a mess. Hasn't set up it's premise well enough. Split it into a bit about versioning. Probably need details and examples here
* Build for change - Ship of theseus
