# APIs On The Scale of Decades

"APIs are hard. They are pretty much ship now, regret later." -- Chet Haase.

What do Greek philosophy, early video games, and Japanese bullet trains tell us about how we should design our APIs?

Writing any old API is easy. Writing an API that can evolve to meet your needs over the coming months, years, and even decades; now that's hard.

Let me give you some good advice that'll help you evolve your APIs, and some big ideas that might provoke some interesting thoughts.
