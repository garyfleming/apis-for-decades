# APIs On The Scale of Decades

A talk I first gave in November 2017. It was written in Deckset using Markdown.

The purpose of this talk is less clear and focussed than many of my other talks. There's no straight-forward message. There's no single lesson to take away. There are some ideas that might be useful when building APIs, and some ideas that might just be fanciful.
